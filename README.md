- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool
- must include a README to describe their project

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

## Permission

## Setup
This project builds off of the solo project, Adopt Don't Shop. Between you and your partner, choose which one of your repos you'd like to use. If you choose to use Partner A's solo project, Partner A will clone their project into a new directory and push up to a new repo on github. Then, Partner A should add Partner B as a collaborator to that project.

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code using POROs and adhere to MVC | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class. Even `.each` calls will not cause additional database lookups. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students utilize `before :each` blocks. 100% coverage for features and models |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. | Students use the principles of MVC and POROs vs. Models to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. Action View helpers are used. Routes and Actions are following RESTful conventions. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. Project fully leverages AR associations and methods | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. Scored a 3 or higher in Feature Completeness |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC and POROs to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. Some routes and actions are not restful. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 4 or more User Stories | Students do not effectively organize code using MVC and/or POROs | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. |
